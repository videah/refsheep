{% card(title="intro") %}
Spencer is an otter!
He is often found in no clothing at all as a disney nude but can wear any sort of clothing. 
If he's in clothes, they're not likely to be anything above smart/business casual and
is likely still going to include open toed sandals.
{% end %}

{% card(title="Eyes 👀") %}
Otter has the most common form of heterocromia,
but it's completely optional to include. His eyes are primarily gray and if desired, can include a green accent.
If your going to include the accent, it should be as either an inner circle, or the top inner quadrant of each eye
