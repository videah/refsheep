{% card(title="Clothes?") %}

***Spencer is often found in no clothing at all.***

If he is wearing clothes, he strongly prefers them to be brightly colored. Purple's, blue's, and teal's are favorites. 
He's also more likely to wear shirts than pants. Clothing is not likely to be anything above smart/business casual.

When possible and appropriate he'll wear open toed sandals over shoes.

The only type of swimwear he considers wearing is a pair of jammers

{% card(title="Eyes 👀") %}

Spencer has the most common form of heterocromia!
but it's completely optional to include. His eyes are primarily gray and if desired, can include a green accent.
If your going to include the accent, it should be as either an inner circle, or the top inner quadrant of each eye
