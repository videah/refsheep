He has a close relationship with his son [Videah](/videah/) who he likes to tease.

James has a warm personality can hardly help himself when it comes to cracking jokes. He takes good care of his son who he loves very much and
enjoys spending as much time as he can with.

nobody else there. Even if there is in fact, somebody else there.

Very often has a sly smirk on his face.

Owns a pair of reading glasses, only really wears them whilst working. He works at Xbox. He'll ban you.
